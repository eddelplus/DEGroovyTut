== Grooviness Explained

.A (planned) series of tutorials
[NOTE]
====
This is the first volume of what may over time turn into a longer series of Groovy tutorials.
In the series, this would not be the first part. It assumes that the previous parts have presented
most of the core features of Groovy. Chapters detailing some of the more advanced features of
Groovy would also come before this one: Closures, operator overloading, meta programming.

This allows to reflect on how those Groovy features have been utilized in the creation of the
Groovy JDK for I/O.
====

== Introduction

Using input and ouput is likely one of the most frequent applications of a programming language.
While going through the basic features of Groovy and the additional icing on the cake, like meta
programing, we've been isolated in a lab environment. The console output from _print_ and _println_
was the only visible connection to the outside world.

Encapsulating functionality into classes is the key to creating libraries of reusable code. The
wealth of classes included in the standard Java class library was crucial to Java's rapid
acceptance in the early days.

A key decision in the design of Groovy was not to reinvent classes that are provided by the
JDK (Java Delvelopement Kit) and are fit for purpose already. Rather meta programming was
utilized to make the existing classes a lot _groovier_, turning the plain JDK in to a truly
Groovy JDK. This approach is particularly apparent for I/O (input/output). The JDK provideds
a number of packages, each encompassing a set of classes within a common namespace. All
class definitions in the *java.io* package are automatically imported into any piece of
Groovy code.

Closures, operator overloading and meta programming are the key tools to adding Grooviness
to existing libraries. Even many features that may look like being built into the core syntax
are just clever library design. Appending to a list with << is an overloaded operator while
looping over its entries with .each is an added method that takes a closure as its parameter.

Java I/O was a bit complex right from the start. The virtual machine had to abstract from the
underlying operating system and Unicode support was included from the get go. Before delving
into the details some of these design concepts need to be explained.

== Streams

For ages the smallest unit of information that is transferred in I/O operations is the
byte. File sizes are counted in bytes, TCP/IP sockets and web protocols count in bytes and
so do pipes for inter-process communication. A *stream* is a source or destination for a
sequence of bytes. The JDK provides two basic classes for streams, the *OutputStream* and
the *InputStream*. An OutputStream receives bytes from the Groovy program while an InputStream
delivers them.

Any real-life instance of a Stream needs to be associated with some underlying transport or
storage. To make this distinction the java.io package provides several types of Streams:

.Basic stream classes
[options="header"]
|====
|Storage/Transport|Input|Output
|Files|FileInputStream|FileOutputStream
|Memory|ByteArrayInputStream|ByteArrayOutputStream
|Pipes|PipedInputStream|PipedOutputStream
|====

So let's jump right in and look at some sample code for streams:

.JavaDoc and Groovy Documentation
[TIP]
====
Because Java and Groovy allow for the inclusion of specifically formatted comments in their
source code, which the JavaDoc and GroovyDoc tools can extract and convert into HTML pages,
those documentation pages are the core reference documentation for the class libraries.

Unfortunately the
link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html[Core JDK]
and the
link:http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk[Groovy JDK]
documentation list their capabilities separately. One purpose of this tutorial is join up
the two sides. Being a tutorial, you will not get to see all features here. So for delving
deeper the doc pages will be invaluable going forward.
====

== Readers, Writers, and Character Sets

Most I/O these days uses text formats: XML, JSON, or old CSV. Java has supported Unicode
from its inception. Inside the JVM each character is represented by two bytes. How all or
some Unicode characters are represented in stream I/O depends on the encoding for the
character set utilized. US-ASCII allows characters codes 0 .. 127 in single bytes. The
use of 128 .. 255 in 8-bit character sets varies and has been standardized in various
code pages, with
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859[ISO 8859]
representing the international norm. ISO-8859-1 is also known as Latin-1. It does not
contain the €-sign, which is available in ISO-8859-15, albeit with a code different from
the one used by Microsoft (Windows-1252). To overcome the difficulties with the various
codepages but avoid double bytes across the board the UTF-8 encoding was created. It
represents the US-ASCII characters in single bytes, 1920 selected unicode characters
(including Kyrillic, Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew) in two bytes and the rest of 0 .. 65535
in three bytes. This has made the conversion of a character sequence into a byte sequence
and vice versa quite a bit harder.

A *Reader* is an inbound stream of characters and a *Writer* is an outbound stream of
characters. If they are connected to byte-oriented streams, they will need to carry out
the conversion between characters and bytes as indicated by the character set encoding.

There are in-memory incarnations, that always work with 16-bit characters:
*StringWriter*, *StringReader*, *CharArrayWriter*, and *CharArrayReader*.

The java.io package also introduced the *FileWriter* and *FileReader* classes. Using them
is discouraged, because they always rely on the system character set, making their results
hard to predict.

Any byte I/O can be turned into character I/O by wrapping an InputStream with an
*InputStreamReader* and an OutputStream with an *OutputStreamWriter*.

[source,groovy]
----
def isr = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("groovytut.txt"), "UTF-8")
def osw = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream("new.txt"), "ISO-8859-1")
----

If a stream or writer is wrapped like this, only the outermost incarnation needs to
be closed explicitly. It will then close all wrapped instances. A Reader provides the
same no-frills .read() methods as an InputStream, just for reading a single character
or into a character array provided as an input buffer. A Writer provides several
signatures of the .write() method for individual characters, character arrays and strings.

In text processing formatting data for output and reading input line by line are two
common chores. To get that accomplished, we need to wrap again:

[source,groovy]
def br = new BufferedReader(isr)
def pw = new PrintWriter(osw)

The *BufferedReader* has one notable additional method: *.readLine()*. The internal
buffering is needed to locate the next line feed. Doing that character by character
would drag down performance. The method returns *null* at the end of the stream.

The *PrintWriter* provides for *.print()*, *.println()* and *.printf()* methods. It also
provides some buffering, flushing the buffer after each line feed, unless instructed
otherwise. The Groovy JDK provides this set of methods for any kind of *Writer*.

[WARNING]
====
*.println()* uses the system dependent line ending string. This can be overridden by
setting the _line.separator_ system property. Any single "\n" contained in the strings
being printed *is not converted*.

There is also a *PrintStream* class, which behaves much like *PrintWriter*, except
not allowing to wrap another Writer. Historically it is the class of System.out and System.err.
For clear distinction between encoded and byte output *PrintStream* should be avoided.
====

Now to get here we had to layer three instantiations with *new*. At least
the PrintWriter lets us do that directly, unless we want to append instead of overwrite.
For the BufferedReader there is help from the Groovy JDK, where all readers are typically
buffered when supplied by the *.withReader()* or *.newReader()* methods.

== Data and Object Streams

Now that we've covered text/character based readers and writers we can return to streams
as a means of storing data. But doing that byte for byte might be a bit tedious.

The process of converting an the internal representation of
data (inside the JVM) to a stream of bytes is called serialization. As a means of data
exchange, text based serialization schemes have become very popular, particularly
representing the data in XML or JSON formats. We'll get to XML and JSON serialization and
deserialization in subsequent chapters with ample Grooviness to support.

The disadvantage of XML and JSON, to a lesser extent, is their bulkiness. The number of
bytes transferred can be much smaller when binary representations are utilized. This is the
realm of data and object streams in Java and Groovy.

A *DataOutputStream* or *DataInputStream* can once again be instantiated by wrapping some other
stream. They allow writing and reading all primitive Java data types plus UTF converted strings.
There is a specific method for each. For Groovy this has the advantage that it can carry out
any default conversions into the data type being written. The methods are *.write{_Type_}* and
*.read{_Type_}* respectively, with *_Type_* one of
*Boolean, Byte, Char, Short, Int, Long, Float, Double, and UTF*.

The .writeUTF(String) and .readUTF() methods store the length of the String (with a limit of
32 kB) and its content in a UTF-8 representation. Multi-byte data types are written in a
platform independent byte order. As the sample code shows, the higher order bytes go first.

[source,groovy]
----
include::groovy/streams3.groovy[]
----

Now Groovy programmers with their dynamic use of maps and lists would still be pretty hard pressed
to export even moderately complex data structures as a sequence of primitive values. Here the
JDK comes to the rescue with the *ObjectOutputStream* and *ObjectInputStream*. They take
serialization not just to the next level, but a couple levels higher in a big leap.

These streams can write and read entire objects. For complex data structures where any object
can reference several other objects the interconnections are followed and all dependencies are
written to the stream. All a class needs to do to be eligible for such serialization is to
declare that it implements the java.io.*Serializable* interface. Curiously, this interface doesn't
have any specific methods that need to be implemented.

So here is a serializable class in a separate source file that the Groovy compiler can
locate based on package and class naming conventions:

[source,groovy]
.sample/Container.groovy
----
include::groovy/sample/Container.groovy[]
----

The *public static final long _serialVersionUID_* is not part of the interface. But when using
Groovy for compiling the class it is absolutely vital. It acts as a version number. Any change
to this property indicates that the class definition may have changed in an incompatible way.
Data written with a different serialVersionUID cannot be read back in. Instead a
java.io.InvalidClassException will be thrown. For more background refer to
link:http://www.mkyong.com/java-best-practices/understand-the-serialversionuid[mkyong].

So no sweat pouring here, trying to set the class up for data I/O. In contrast allowing it to check
equality based on member content does require an explicit implementation of .equals(). The choice of
42000L is completely arbitrary. 1L is as good a choice, as there is no need to have unique values
across different classes.

Another important prerequisite for serialization is that each member property needs to be serializable
as well. Luckily, the implementations for lists and maps that Groovy utilizes do fulfill this
prerequisite, as do all primitives, strings and arrays.

Now some sample code based on our class definition
